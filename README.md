<b>Description</b>
<p>My leetcode solutions in C++ (11)</p>
<p>Leetcode Online Judge address: https://oj.leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/</p>
<p>Lintcode Online Judge address: http://www.lintcode.com/en/daily/</p>
<div>
  <p>Easy problems were long done before but I didn't keep the code. Since I would do it again I would update the solutions later. For all problems I would try to upload solutions with best performance.</p>
  <p>Only part of lintcode solutions are available, some solutions might have better performance than they do in leetcode</p>

<b>Usage</b>
<p>For leetcode, search with problem number. For lintcode, lookup for the problem tags or just search for problem name</p>
